# Project

➡️ This project is the 2D PyGame based **rhythm game**, based on my Python skills which are improving _**everyday**_.

➡️ The game will be rewritten in the future using game engine and maybe C# language.

➡️ Game will have its **website**, with scores and user profiles.

➡️ I'm still learning things, so feel free to contact with me on _Discord:_ **Hajp#6610**
